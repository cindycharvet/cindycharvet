I'm a front-end developer 👩🏻‍💻 who thrives on building beautiful, modular interfaces. Design thinking meets pixel perfection? My jam! 🚀 I bring a creative approach and project management know-how to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end. Let's code something awesome together!

📱 My interfaces adapt like chameleons, always looking their best on any screen.
🤯 I turn heads (and clicks!) with innovative ideas that solve problems and delight users.
💜 I believe in teamwork, working closely with others to ensure smooth project flow.
